          <p>
            During my first year as front-end developer student, I have been building some sites for different subjects. All sites has been improved
            through out my first year.
          </p>
          <p>
            SquareEyes for movies purchase was my first project at start of my studies , then I went on to built Community Science museum site, an
            informational site for newly opened museum. And third one being, personal blogging website which focuses on fetching data from wordpress
            rest-api.

              <p>
                I managed to get to functional level process 2 where we was tasked to collect user data and add search option when I delivered
                project. Basically, I am really satisfied with design, functionality and user experience for Project exam "ankson-blog". Some big
                changes were made during production, which eventually improved functionality. So not much I have worked on this project. Since I am
                also didn't get teacher feedback for exam.
              </p>
              <p>
                One thing which I would like to work further on , is to get easilly submitted e-mail for subscribe section. Which unfortunately, I
                didn't find a way to do it. I did use contact form 7 to collect form data but didnot find any specific routes on wordpress rest-api

                <li>Background color in header</li>
                <li>Padding in header</li>

              <h4>Why updates were necessary</h4>
              <p>
                I thought header looked quite busy with background color and not so much breathing space. I felt, I should try to improve somehow.
                Another aspect was growing line on hover, got lots os attention because of being quite thick. While last changes were to reduce nav
                items in header sections. I felt again that was too much going on in header section
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>How changes were Implemented</h4>
              <p>
                First removed background color and kept rather plain white background and then added some padding to give that enough room which
                needed for elements. Then I went on to add dropdown menu to further reduce menu items in nav section. Added mouse over event to keep
                to minimal while keeping user informed that there are more sub-menus in header.
              </p>
              <p>Growing line on hover was thinned out to reduce direct attention rather keeping it simple animation going.</p>

              <h4>Why updates were necessary</h4>
              <p>
                As a user, you must be able to contact site owner for possible feedback or queries. Which I didn't think about when designing site. So
                contact page was necessary. After going back to redesign, I felt that it was hard to read codes in html and js files, particulary was
                hard to find out for what or where they belong to. So description or commenting was necessary for readability. Some other issues I
                came up was, button on hover snapping back which kinda didn't feel smooth user experience.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>How changes were Implemented</h4>
              <p>
                As per teacher's feedback, contact page was missing for site. I added contact page and I didn't find place for contact button in
                navigation, since it wasn't actually part of design. So I added button in footer section which takes user to contact form. I further
                went on to clean up some messy code and added comments on each section, which helps for readability specially when there is lots of
                content in html pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some transition properties added, so button did notsnap back when user leaves button, rather add smooth transition which I think feels
                much better as user.
